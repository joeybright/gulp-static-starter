# gulp-static-starter

A boilerplate I use to create static sites with Gulp.

## To get started

Make sure npm and bower are installed, then install dependencies using npm:

      npm install

And bower:

      bower install

Then, run gulp

      gulp

This will watch for any changes in the /src directory and build out the site to /build
